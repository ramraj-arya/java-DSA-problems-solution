You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int max = 0;
        int fi = -1;
        int li = -1;
        for (int i = 0 ; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                continue;
            } else if (fi == -1) {
                fi = i;
                li = i;
            } else {
                li = i;
            }
        }

        // if all values are zero in array
        if (fi == -1) {
            return n <= (flowerbed.length + 1) / 2;
        }

        max = fi / 2; // left zero how many 1 can come
        max += (flowerbed.length - li -1) / 2; // right side zero how many 1 can come
        // midle part zeros
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = fi + 1; i <= li - 1; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                count++;
            } else {
                max += (count - 1) / 2;
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        max += (count - 1) / 2;
        return n <= max;
    }
}
